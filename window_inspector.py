Window Inspector Script

A simple diagnostic tool to list all top-level windows visible to pywinauto.
This helps identify the exact window title for applications when the standard
connect() method fails.

Usage:
1. Make sure the target application (e.g., Copilot) is open and visible.
2. Run this script from your terminal: python window_inspector.py
3. Look for the application's title in the output list.
